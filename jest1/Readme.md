Jest is a delightful javascript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.

It works with projects using : Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue, and more.

suppose you have multiple test cases so what we will do so firstly write w in your terminal and react all the instruction

And write the p and then give prticular fileName which file we will and check the test case. npm run test => and also setup the script in package.json file.

some library of we will install.
npm i --save-dev jest
npm i --save-dev @types/jest

npm i -g jest and run the "node_modules\.bin\jest" --init for the jest.config.js file some of instruction are given there when create jest.config.js file so all the suggetions no and one is node and one is v8 that's it.

Inside of jest.config.jest we will comment on some things like testMatch, testPathIgnorePatterns, coverageProvider, coveragePathIgnorePatterns.

After that install the npm i @babel/preset-env --save-dev package for creating .babelrc file.
